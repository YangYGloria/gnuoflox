= Going Backwards: Running GNU OFlox Under MS Windows =

This section covers the necesary steps to make GNU Oflox work under *MS Windows XP*

== Software Requirements and Setup ==

The folloing software is required (tested version):

 * Microsoft Windows XP (Version 6.0.6000). Note: GNU Oflox requires a _Windows Command Interpreter_ that can handle the 

`for I in (set) do %nI` 

directive correctly. For more information in this topic, try 
`for /?` on the command prompt of CMD.EXE.
 * [http://octave.sourceforge.net/ GNU Octave windows version from OctaveForge] (Version 3.2.2)
 * [http://miktex.org/ MikTeX distribution] (Version 2.8), after instalation, make *sure* you download the folloing extra latex packages
   * xcolor
   * graphics
   * geometry
   * amsfonts
   * amsmath 
 * [http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php Graphviz program] (Version 2.24.0)

Install all and make sure the `dot`, `latex` and `dvipdfm` programs can be accessible via the CMD.EXE console interpreter, that is,

`start->run...` then type `CMD.EXE [enter]`

on the command prompt, try

`dot -V`

Should appear

`dot - graphviz version 2.24.0 (20090616.2323)`

then, check the latex distribution

`latex -version`

which should say

`MiKTeX-pdfTeX 2.8.3512 (1.40.10) (MiKTeX 2.8)`

== Installing the GNU Oflox Package ==
Download from [http://code.google.com/p/gnuoflox/downloads/list here] the latest gnuoflox-x.y.z-tar.gz package file and save it on your Desktop.

To install the GNU Oflox package, open GNU Octave and on the prompt type:

`octave-3.2.2.exe:1:C:\Octave\3.2.2_gcc-4.3.0\bin

`> cd '~\Desktop'`

`octave-3.2.2.exe:2:~\Desktop`

`> pkg install gnuoflox-x.y.z-tar.gz'`

== Loading and Using it ==
Before using the `oflox()` function, you need to first load the package, on the GNU Octave console type:

`octave-3.2.2.exe:3:~\Desktop`

`> pkg load gnuoflox`

and now we con use it! Lets give it a try

== Step by Step Example ==

`octave-3.2.2.exe:4:~\Desktop`

`> conf = ofloxconfig`

`octave-3.2.2.exe:5:~\Desktop`

`> conf.latex = 1; conf.compiledvi = 1;

We are now ready to solve a problem, the package includes a few simple problems, lets solve one of them

`octave-3.2.2.exe:6:~\Desktop`

`> [ Z X it it0 ] = oflox('', conf);`
