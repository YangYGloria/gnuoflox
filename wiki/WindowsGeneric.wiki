= Going Backwards: Running GNU OFlox Under MS Windows =

This section covers the necesary steps to make GNU Oflox work under MS Windows XP

== Software Requirements ==

The folloing software is required (tested version):

 * [http://octave.sourceforge.net/ GNU Octave windows version from OctaveForge] (Version 3.2.2)
 * [http://miktex.org/ MikTeX distribution] (Version 2.8), after instalation, make *sure* you download the folloing extra latex packages
   * xcolor
   * graphics
   * geometry
   * amsfonts
   * amsmath 
 * [http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php Graphviz program] (Version 2.24.0)

Install all three of these programs and make sure the can be accessible via the CMD.EXE console program, that is,

`start->run...` then type `CMD.EXE /E:ON [enter]`

on the command prompt, try

`dot -V`

Should appear

`dot - graphviz version 2.24.0 (20090616.2323)`

then, check the latex distribution

`pdflatex -version`

which should say

`MiKTeX-pdfTeX 2.8.3512 (1.40.10) (MiKTeX 2.8)`

*CRITICAL NOTE 1: GNU Oflox only works if GNU Octave is run in a CMD.EXE environment with the COMMAND EXTENSIONS enabled, to enable them run the CMD.EXE command with the /E:ON switch.* 

*CRITICAL NOTE 2: The CMD.EXE /? help pages state the COMMAND EXTENSIONS are enable by default (/E:ON), but the GNU Octave system call DOES NOT inherit it, that is why you neet to run GNU Octave from a console with this switch enabled explicitly.*

Now we need to install the GNU Oflox package, open GNU Octave and on the prompt type:

`octave-3.2.2.exe:1:C:\Octave\3.2.2_gcc-4.3.0\bin

`> cd '~\Desktop'`

`octave-3.2.2.exe:2:~\Desktop`

`> pkg install gnuoflox-x.y.z-tar'`
