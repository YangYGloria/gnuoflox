= A simple example =

In the following example we solve the [Introduction#Usage same problem used in the introduction page], described by the file 

`~/octave/gnuoctave-1.0.2/doc/nets/pfmc300.min`

but using FASE I/II and setting the output to a PDF file showing the initial problem, the steps involved and the optimum solution.

= Details =
[http://code.google.com/u/talassio/ I] strongly sugest to open a new folder for each problem to solve, so let's start off by opening the console, creating a new folder named `fmc3` and moving in to it

`cd ~`

`mkdir fmc3 && cd fmc3` 

Start up octave and load the package,

`octave:1> pkg load gnuoflox` 

then type

`config = ofloxconfig;`

in order to customize the diverse settings. Let's 
enable FASE I/II and disable Big-M methods
  * `config.FASE1 = true;`
  * `config.BIGM = false;`
enable the \LaTeX output
  * `config.latex = true;`
  * `config.compiledvi = true;`

and finally, set a name for the problem to solve
  * `config.aname = 'fmc3';`

Now we are ready to solve the problem!

indicating that the problem's objective optimum value is 4 units *as expected* (see the [Introduction#Usage Introductory page]) and can be achieved by setting each arc's flow as indicated by the vector X, it required *only* 1 Simplex FMC iterations but *6* FASE I iterations. Besides this information we note the output states

indicating the output was written to `[http://gnuoflox.googlecode.com/files/master_fmc3.pdf master_fmc3.pdf]` and `master_fmc3.dvi`. if we look at the contents of the current working directory we note there are some new files, namely

but for now the *only* file we are interested is *[http://gnuoflox.googlecode.com/files/master_fmc3.pdf master_fmc3.pdf]*, go ahead and open it in your favourite PDF viewer and look at it's contents.

Most of the files listed in the above table are the \LaTeX source files to generate master_fmc3.pdf, the can be view and edited. The most important file is master_fmc3.tex that is the one that includes all the other TeX source files, you are encouraged to view, edit and explore all the source files!
